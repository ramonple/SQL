185 & 262 are two hard problems, but I also find other questions challenging.
importance: 
a. Should better understand the self join
b. Not always we must use 'where' clause. I can use ON when we join tables. 
   For example A Join B ON a.id=b.userid and b.userid > 10;
    

-- 175. Combine Two Tables
In this question, it requires ' If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report 'null' instead'.
In this situation, we need to use LEFT JOIN.

Select firstname, lastname,city,state
From Person LEFT JOIN Address
ON Person.PersonId=Address.PersonId
Order by firstName

 -- 176. Second Highest Salary
 Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. 
 If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.
 The importance is how to deal with 'when there is no second highest then shows NULL'.
 < IFNULL> function
 SELECT IFNULL(xxxxx, "yyy") as YourNameIt; if not null, output corresponding value, if null ouput ''yyyy''
 here the xxxx can be a complete <select..from..order by.. limite..offset.. section>
 <OFFSET> 
 OFFSET  Number of rows to skip  e.g., OFFSET 1
 <Limit>
If a limit count is given, no more than that many rows will be returned

SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
    
    
-- 177. Nth Highest Salary
Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null
Similar as the one above, the importance is how to output the null.
after trying, I found MySQL cannot directly calculate the value of n-1. Thus, we need to find help from the function.
To relize this, we need to use the FUNCTION.

CREATE FUNCTION yourFunctionName(Variable INT) RETURNS INT -- INT is the data type
BEGIN
SET N=N-1; -- here you can do your own setting
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT
        IFNULL(
          (SELECT DISTINCT salary
          FROM Employee
          ORDER BY salary DESC
          LIMIT 1 OFFSET N),
            NULL) AS nthhisghestsalary --  this part is the same as the one did in 176
  );
END

-- 178. Rank Scores
Write an SQL query to rank the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:
a.The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
b.If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
c.After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.
d.Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

Create Table Scores
(id int, score decimal(10,2), Primary Key (id));

When creating the table, we should focus on the decimals, it should be decimal (p,s) such as decimal(10,2).
p is the precision which is the maximum total number of decimal digits that will be stored, both to the left and to the right of the decimal point.
s is the scale which is the number of decimal digits that will be stored to the right of the decimal point.

select score, Dense_RANK() OVER (order by score DESC) as "RANK"
from scores

DISTINGUISH:  RANK DENSE_RANK Row_number
RANK: 113446
DENSE_RANK:112334
Row_number: 12345

- [180. Consecutive Numbers} !!!
Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
Return the result table in any order.

Approach: Using DISTINCT and WHERE clause [Accepted]

Consecutive appearing means the Id of the Num are next to each others. Since this problem asks for numbers appearing at least three times 
consecutively, we can use 3 aliases for this table Logs, and then check whether 3 consecutive numbers are all the same.

select DISTINCT l1.num AS consecutiveNumbers
from logs as l1,
     logs as l2,
	  	logs as l3
Where l1.id = l2.id - 1
AND l2.id=l3.id-1
And l1.num=l2.num
And l2.num=l3.num

-- Answer from Discussion
SELECT DISTINCT t.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
(
SELECT Num AS num, LEAD(Num) OVER (ORDER BY Id) AS 'lead', LAG(Num) OVER (ORDER BY Id) AS 'lag'
From Logs
) AS t
WHERE t.num = t.lead and t.num = t.lag

-- LEAD() is a window function. by using the LEAD() function, from the current row, you can access the data of the [following] row.
-- LAG: by using the LAG() function, from the current row, you can access data of the [previous] row

-- Syntax: LAG (scalar_expression [,offset] [,default])  OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause ) 
-- offset: The number of rows back from the current row from which to obtain a value. If not specified, the default is 1. 
-- default: The value to return when offset is beyond the scope of the partition. If a default value is not specified, NULL is returned.

-- 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
- first, i need to understand this table.

select a.name as Name
from employee as a JOIN employee as b
On a.managerId=b.id
Where a.salary > b.salary

182. Duplicate Emails

select Email, count(Email) as num
from Person2
Group by Email
having num > 1

select email from person2
group by email
having count(email) > 1

- 183. Customers Who Never Order
-- Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.
select customers.name
from customers
where customers.id NOT IN (
select customers.id
from customers JOIN orders ON customers.id=orders.customerid)


-- 197. Rising Temperature
- Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

In this question, we should know how to use DATEDIFF as an condition.

select a.id AS 'id'
from weather a JOIN weather b
on DATEDIFF(a.recordDate,b.recordDate) = 1 And a.temperature > b.temperature
And a.temperature > b.temperature


-- 262. Trips and Users (HARD)
The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users 
by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) 
each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

select request_at as "Day", ROUND(SUM(CASE when t.status!= 'completed' then 1 ELSE 0 END)/count(*), 2) as "Cancellation Rate"
from Trips t
inner join Users a on (a.users_id = t.client_id) and  (a.banned="No")
inner join Users b on (b.users_id = t.driver_id) and  (b.banned="No")
where request_at between "2013-10-01" AND "2013-10-03"
group by request_at;
