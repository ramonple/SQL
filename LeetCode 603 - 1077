-- 603 Consecutive Available Seats [Easy]
-- Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?

-- Note:

-- The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
-- Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.


-- my approach: (referring to the approach applied in Q601)

WITH
AP as (
select a.seat_id as A, b.seat_id as B
from cinema a LEFT JOIN cinema b ON a.seat_id=b.seat_id -1
where a.free = 1 and b.free =1 ),

SP as (
select A as seat from AP. -- at first attempt, I make a mistake here. We should notice FROM should be the table defiend before
UNION 
select B as seat from AP
)

select seat_id
from cinema
where seat_id IN (select seat from SP);

-- through this approach, the column satisfied are shown in differnt columns, so we should use the UNION

-- Leetcode answer
SELECT DISTINCT a.seat_id
FROM cinema AS a JOIN cinema AS b
ON ABS(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1. -- first time see this, as in this question, there is no date, no particular sequence 
                                  -- through abs(xx-xx) = 1 we can make sure these two seats are con
AND a.free = 1 AND b.free = 1
ORDER BY a.seat_id;
-- through this approach, we dont need to do the UNION step

-- it seems this can also be used for two consecutive thing. I applied it to Q601, where with 3 consecutive date, it does not work.

-- 608 Tree Node [Medium]
-- Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

-- Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
-- Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
-- Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

-- Write a query to print the node id and the type of the node. Sort your output by the node id. The result for the above sample is:

select id, 
CASE WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
      WHEN id NOT IN (select DISTINCT p_id from tree where p_id is NOT NULL) THEN 'leaf'
			ELSE 'Inner' 
   END AS Type
from tree
-- it seems like we can have only one 'ELSE' in When clause

-- for example:
SELECT player_name,
       weight,
       CASE WHEN weight > 250 THEN 'over 250'
            WHEN weight > 200 THEN '201-250'
            WHEN weight > 175 THEN '176-200'
            ELSE '175 or under' END AS weight_group
  FROM benn.college_football_players
  
-- OR 
select id,
(Case when p_id is NULL then 'Root'
      when id IN  (select p_id from tree where p_id IS NOT NULL) THEN 'INNER'
			ELSE 'LEAF' END ) as TYPE
from tree



-- 610 Triangle Judgement [Easy]

-- A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.

-- However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.

select x,y,z,
( Case when x+y> z and x+z>y AND y+z > x then 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END )AS triangle
from triangle

-- Another approach
select *,

    FROM triangle;
-- SELECT IF(500<1000, "YES", "NO");

-- 612 Shortest Distance in a Plane [Medium]
-- Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.

-- find out the shortest distance between two points

-- !! I have no idea two to deal with this!!
-- for the relationship inside a table should use the 'self join'

select  DISTINCT ( POWER(a.x-b.x,2) + POWER(a.y-b.y,2)) as shortest
from point_2d as a
JOIN point_2d as b
ON a.x<>b.x OR a.y<>b.y.  -- focus on this condition
order by shortest
LIMIT 1
-- POWER( base, exponent )

SELECT
ROUND(MIN(SQRT(POW(a.x - b.x, 2) + POW(a.y - b.y, 2))),2) AS shortest
FROM point_2d AS a
JOIN point_2d AS b
ON a.x <> b.x OR a.y <> b.y;  -- -- focus on this condition


-- 613 Shortest Distance in a Line [Easy]
-- Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
-- The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:

select MIN( POWER(a.x-b.x,2)) As 'shortest'
from point a JOIN point b ON a.x<>b.x

-- WRONG!!!! these two are on a line. The distance should be |x1-x2|!!
select min(abs(a.x-b.x)) As 'shortest'
from point a JOIN point b ON a.x<>b.x

-- 614 Second Degree Follower [Medium]

FROM follow AS a LEFT JOIN follow AS b 
ON a.follower = b.followee
where b.follower is not null
group by a.follower

-- better understand this qustions. the Follower of the Follower -- > self join needed!

 -- 618 Students Report By Geography [Hard]
 -- A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. The students' location information are stored in table student as below.

-- and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. 
-- The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. 
-- It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.

 -- How to pivot table???????????????
 -- use ROW_NUMBER() OVER (partition by   order by)
 
 SELECT
