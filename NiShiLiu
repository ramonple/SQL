-- how to get the slip average



# Easy mistakes:
count(*) null will be included
count(column_name) null wil NOT be included





##  group_concat: one to many search

find the id for male and female students, like

gender    id
female.   01,02,08,09
male.     12,14,22

SELECT gender, group_concat(id) as id
FROM table
GROUP BY gender


## aggregate function
count(): count(*) will calculate the null cell, count(x) will not calculate the null cel
avg()
sum()
max()
min()
first()
last()

## window function + aggregate function
1. row_number() 1234, rank()1224, dese_rank() 1223
2. sum() over(), count() over(), avg() over()
3.percent_rank(),cume_dist()
4.lag(expression,n), lead(expression,n) , n is the step size !!!!

>>>>> 2 !!!!!!- < slip window function> - rows mode (according to physical row, i.e., product A, product B)
                         - range mode (according to values)
                         
function() over([partition by] [order by] [frame])

frame:
unbounded preceding -- that the window starts at the first row of the partition
expression preceding -- only allow rows mode
current row
expression following -- only allow rows mode
unbounded folowing

< Preceding refers to rows before the current row, where the following argument refers to rows after the current row.>

example:
select main_category, sub_category, year_month,sales, sum(sales) over (order by year_month ROWS/Range unbounded preceding) as sum_by_sub_cat
from table
select main_category, sub_category, year_month,sales, sum(sales) over (order by year_month ROWS between 6 preceding and current row) as sum_by_sub_cat
from table
rows: different product type in the same month are NOT the same
range: different product type in the same month are  the same
                         

-> Cumulative Sum

select main_category, sub_category, year_month, sales, sum(sales) over (partition by sub_category order by year_month) as cum_sum
from table 
( you can also change the sum here to other aggregate functions, like avg() ).


## how to find the top 10% sales?

PERCENT_RANK = (RANK – 1)/(COUNT -1)
CUME_DIST = RANK/COUNT

PERCENT_RANK returns the percent of values less than the current score. 
CUME_DIST, which stands for cumulative distribution, returns the actual position of the score.

example:
SELECT product, percent_rank() over( order by sales DESC) as 'perent_rank',
                cume_dist() over( oder by sales DESC) as 'cume_dist'
FROM Table

-- ntile():
NTILE() function in SQL Server is a window function that distributes rows of an ordered partition into a pre-defined number of roughly equal groups.
        break a result set into a specified number of buckets.
NTILE (n) OVER( partition by xxx order by yyy)
n: is the integer into which the rows are divided.

for example, we still want the top 10%

select product, ntile(10) over (order by sales DESC) as ntile_rank
from table
having ntile_rank = 1


### DATE

- change the string into date: STR_TO_DATE(string, format_mask)
select_to_date('09/01/2009', '%m%d%y' ) as date


- change the date format: DATE_FORMAT(date,format)
DATE_FORMAT('2009/01/01', ' %Y - %m- %d')

- split the date: 
year(current_date)
month(current_date)
week(current_date)
day(current_date)

- change the time (ealier or later)

- first day of this month: DATE_FORMAT(current_date, '%Y-%m-01')
- last day of this month: last_day(current_date)
-- two days ealier: date_sub (current_date, interval 2 day)
-- two days later: date_add(current_date, interval 2 day)
-- same day last month: date_sub(current_day, interval 1 month)


### regular expression
RegExp ' a|b'  RegExp '[0-9]'. RegExp '[a-zA-Z0-9]
RegExp_like

############# date and time

1. current time now(), current_date()
select now() as current_time -- year-month-day-hour-minute-second
select current_date -- year-month-day

2. extract time: year(current_date),month(current_date),week(current_date),day(current_date)
NOTICE: week - the week of this year
        day - the day of this month
        
3. time stamp: date_add(current_date, interval x day/month/year)
               date_sub(current_date, interval x day/month/year)
               first day of this month: Date_sub(current_date, interval day(current_date) - 1  day)
               last day of this month: last_day(current_date)
               datediff(date('2021-09-21',date('2021-09-20')) as diff ( in most cases, we let date1 > date 2, date 1 later than date2
               
4.date partition and trasform
             select unix_timestamp(current_date)
             -- the output is 1632585600

Slip average
############## leetcode: average number for each 7 days (slipping average)

########## Advanced Case When
1. case when with aggerage function

case when aggerage_function = 1 then aggerage_function else aggregate_function END
group by xxx

2. case when in case when

case whne xx then xx else (case when xx then xx else xx end) end

3. case when with sub-query

case when x then xx when xx = (select ...) then xx end

example 1&2:

select student_id,
       CASE
       WHEN count(*) = 1 Then Max(club_id)
       ELSE MAX( CASE
       WHEN main_club_flag = 'Y' THEN club_id END)
       END  as club_id
from 
      table
Group by
      student_id
      
why should we use max(club_id) instead of club_id? Because there is a group by, we should use the aggerage function

example 3:

    select
         student_id,
         case
            when 
               student_id IN (select student_id in table2)
             then 
               club_id
             End as club_id
    from
         table 1
         
Never forget END!!!
ELSE can be ignored, if there is no else, the output will be NULL

       WHERE: the restriction on the left table
     

join / inner join:
      ON: restrictions on the right table, use the satisfied partition to join the left table
      WHERE: the restrictions on the right table, the join with the left table, as remain the content satisfied the where condition
      (here, the on and where can be considered as the SAME)



#### ROLLUP

The ROLLUP is an extension of the GROUP BY clause. 
The ROLLUP option allows you to include extra rows that represent the subtotals, 
which are commonly referred to as super-aggregate rows, along with the grand total row. 
By using the ROLLUP option, you can use a single query to generate multiple grouping sets.

Group By c1,c2,c3 WITH ROLLUP

c1>c2>c3
(c1,c2,c3)
(c1,c2)
(c1)
0

select
    coalesce('year','TTL') as 'year',
    coalesce(product, 'TTL') as product,
    sum(sales) as sum_sales
from table
group by year, product with rollup

-- COALESCE() Function Returns the first non-null value in a list   


########### IFNULL/COALESCE/NULLIF
-- deal with the NULL cells:
ifnull( column, a) is column is null, replace by a
ifnull(columnA,columnB, a) is column A is null, replace by column B; if B is null, replace by a
-- check whether same or not:
nullif(column1,clumn2) if column1=column2, then null; else column1

Obviously, this is not what we want.
To deal with this problem, we should use aggregative function, such as SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG()

select student.id,
       sum(case when subject = 'Math' then score end) as 'Math',
       sum(case when subject = 'English' then score end) as 'English',
